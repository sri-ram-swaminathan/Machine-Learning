This repository contains my work from all the courses I have taken to teach myself Machine Learning.

- [ISL Python](https://github.com/sri-ram-swaminathan/Machine-Learning/tree/main/ISL%20Python): the first Machine Learning text I followed, and I have gained a solid understanding of theory and code behind supervised / classical ML from here. 

- [Neural Networks Zero to Hero](https://github.com/sri-ram-swaminathan/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Neural%20Networks%20Zero%20to%20Hero): i learnt to build many types of neural networks from first principles, and worked all the way up to GPT and it's tokenizer. 

Aside from this excellent course, I also read the [textbook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen, and wrote an [article](https://sriramswaminathan.com/technical/neuralnetworks/) explaining in depth the theory and code of a vanilla neural network. 

- [Computer Vision](): my two projects from the course I took as part of my Master's
